<h1>Popularity of Cricket</h1>
<p style="font-size:24px">Cricket is not a traditional sport in most of Europe but is growing due to a combination of dedicated organisers and immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, where the sport is the most popular. In countries like Germany, for example, cricket is the fastest growing sport and there are now more than 10,000 players.</p>
<p style="font-size:24px">It is no surprise that cricket is so popular here as a quintessentially English sport, but the popularity of the game has skyrocketed in recent times and it is now technically the second most popular global sport behind football. Cricket is a fantastic sport to both play and watch and could become even more popular in the coming years for a few different reasons.<br />
cricket is growing all over the world. International Cricket Council (ICC) has recognises more than 125 countries that play cricket.</p>
<p style="font-size:24px">Where Is Cricket Standing Right Now<br /><br />
Saying that the international cricket scene evolved remarkably in recent years is almost an understatement. The sport with a huge following base in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh managed to increase its presence in other territories that aren’t historically known for playing cricket. Currently, there are 105 countries that play cricket on a professional level. All these countries are members of the International Cricket Council, however, just 12 of them are full members. So, we can say that the full members are currently the country’s most heavily promoting cricket around the world. These are:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>India</li>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Pakistan</li>
<li>South Africa</li>
<li>England</li>
<li>New Zealand</li>
<li>Afghanistan</li>
<li>West Indies</li>
<li>Sri Lanka</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
<li>Bangladesh</li>
<li>Zimbabwe</li>
 </ul>

<p style="font-size:24px">Furthermore, international events like the ICC Cricket World Cup, T20 World Cup, or the Ashes Series contribute to making the sport more popular with each year that passes. It looks like the mainstream media is also slowly getting on-board to help promote this high-intensity and very enjoyable sport. However, what is still missing? What can make cricket a true contender for football and other popular sports like tennis or basketball?</p>
